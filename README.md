# mern-app-vercel

Project for my assignment for Module 5: **Back-end - NoSQL in the cloud**

- Go to the [guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/61d321e7ef0b55000925bc5b)
- Go to the [live demo](https://mern-app-vercel.vercel.app/)

## The assignment

- I wanted to follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUbNn0voiBI) to create a **React app** but it did not go as planned because I could not deploy on Vercel.

- So I deciced to follow this other [tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-nextjs-with-mongodb-and-deploy-on-vercel/) to create a **Next.js app** and it went as planned.

- But then I wanted to figure out why the React app was not working on Vercel (although it worked locally) so I tried to deploy on Vercel another React app, the one from the [tutorial](https://ellertsmarik.medium.com/), check out this repository if you're interested: [hello-back-end-NoSQL](https://github.com/tristan-sch/hello-back-end-NoSQL).

- Finally I could update the React app from the first [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUbNn0voiBI) and deploy it on Vercel. Check out this repository if you're interested: [Frontend-mern-notes-app](https://github.com/tristan-sch/Frontend-mern-notes-app).
